On top of this and probably hardest of all you had to satisfy yourself  that the release would not impact the performance of our Enterprise clients. Your diligence and professionalism as always shone through and you managed to pull it all together to get us to a stance for the release when compared to the baseline and a stance on the impact of adding 2500 communities to the System.
