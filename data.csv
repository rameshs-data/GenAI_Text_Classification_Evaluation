"The GB Claims team is ramping up the scale of migrations from one every few years or months, to hundreds per week. Automation of migration is a critical dependency now, since we can no longer sustain manual updates for so many clients. The program was in a pinch, since we need to migrate 1200 clients over the next few weeks, but our initial attempts at finding an automation solution for GPM (which routes claims for a client to the old or new system, and must change during migration/cut-over) only uncovered partial solutions. On hearing the critical dependency, Peter, Fred, and Gary cleared their calendars (despite many other super-urgent and pressing priorities) to solve this for CST, present a working POT demo, and hand-off to our squads for full implementation - all in a single morning (today). The impact is that the PLE squads have sufficient time to finish and prepare an emergency/interim solution, which will keep our migrations rolling at full speed - without having to add numerous business stakeholders over multiple weekends to manually perform those updates.

"Dear Sai, Upgrade is one of the most challenging and risky operations. Customers need to set up a maintenance window for upgrade in quiet time without any operation or causing potential business impact. Config convert accounted for 20+ minutes of upgrade time per APIC node when DB is big (event manager DB for example could be several GB due to accumulated data). There were a couple attempts before to solve this problem, however it hit various roadblocks due to issues and not resulting in much reduction. In ACI 6.0.3 release, you guys have come together with this innovative and outstanding solution. We were able to reduce 20+ minute db convert to around 30 seconds in our testing. We believe this would be the case for most upgrades. This wouldn't be possible without your technical expertise, dedication and close collaboration across among two teams. This is critical area, we have set the bar pretty high for quality and maximizing the outcome with minimal side effect. We have gone through a few rounds of revisions, so many rounds of testings and in the end we struck a perfect balance with solution committed to 6.0.3. Congratulations for solving this challenging problem, it is a big accomplishment which customers will benefit for a long time. Sai, thank you so much for overseeing this project end to end and providing the guidance/advices all the way. Your valuable insight and technical expertise is so critical to this project. Keep it up and looking forward to major optimization for user query. Kevin",False

It can't have been easy to organise your other two teams, while acting as SM, PO and QA for another but you were unphased throughout. I think within the first sprint you had a brand new team functioning at quiet a high level. By the first retrospective, it was as if we had done it all a hundred times before, we even managed to double our velocity by the second or third sprint. Even when your work was done, and the team was ready to be handed over to the next SM, you volunteered to come in on release day, proving there are no roles in scrum, and put on your QA hat. By the end of a very long day your brain had turned to mush, Vinod and Nadine said you kept saying the name ""lori"" over and over again and would scroll up when they asked you to scroll down. Not sure what all that was about but thank you for sacrificing some of your mental health, and your physical health, to get us over the line. Hvala!",False

In summary, we wouldn’t have achieved all we did in 2017.5.0 without you! And…You did all that without Phoenix release being affected! Thanks for all your hard work! ",False

I described a training session where I'd be giving a demo through WebEx to a computer at Merck, where they'd then live webcast to what I was told could be 10,000 managers.

Thank you, instead, for your enormous Respect for Customers!  In the end, it was a flawless tech experience. But I can't tell you how reassured I was just having you here. And you were so committed to guarding against any possible snafu. You offered great suggestions for closing my apps and restarting my computer. You suggested I plug in and fetched your own power cord. You even lent me your phone charger when my battery level made you nervous.

This is in recognition of the amazing job you did with the Release Performance Testing in trying circumstances that came with this hughly important Release for Workhuman as a company.

"Colm, just to recognize your vision in figuring out how we could authenticate, log and control SSH access to AWS EC2 instances. Our security consultants BSI reminded us of an issue we have been living with since last years audit on governance and security of our linux VMs in AWS by attempting to use a standard bastion based approach. That night you went off, unprompted to research and found a much more secure and usable solution. You then implemented the new regime across all our VMs in devtest/preprod in time for the followup review and audit with BSI. Subsequently patiently demoing, showing him the concept and the new systems/session manager, to get him up to speed on this unfamiliar and more secure service. It was novel to him, but we could see, you were teaching him, in your patient, respectful and considerate way. Ultimately this patience and tenacity allowed us to arrive at consensus on an efficient and secure way forward. I bet he will be recommending session manager at his next security review! Very well done on the initiative, the idea, the implementation, the demo and most importantly, the respect.",True

"Way to go Biogen Team!  I was lucky enough to join a call with Biogen executives yesterday to hear first-hand how we turned a “the house is burning down” situation into a WIN.  Biogen called urgently to “suspend” their program as a result of an audit that showed signs of potential ‘fraudulent usage’.  Christa, you jumped into action bringing in Eileen (in Mirfie’s absence) to help walk them back from an approach that would have  very negatively impacted employees as well as the program.  The team then worked diligently together to present a plan of action that put the leadership’s mind at ease, push positive communications about the program out to their leaders, as well as improve the revenue opportunity for us  as the program moves forward.  On the one call yesterday,  it was incredible to hear our own words being repeated back to us regarding “the importance of not being too heavy handed in our approach with employees”, “the importance of keeping employees engaged in the program” and “further manager training to set the stage for impact and success”.

Sarah, you are Workhuman’s preeminent rumbler! Thank you for providing a safe and open space for me to riff on work life and pursuit of the common good.

"Ray, while we were at Ignite you posted a helpful message on Slack's #general channel that I knew I would use at some point down the road. Well, it's ONE day back from Ignite and I am already using your helpful tip!! To give a little background, your message was that we can send a ""request for file upload"" that would allow contacts outside of Workhuman to securely upload large files to our OneDrive accounts. I hadn't planned on our strategic account, Baker Hughes, suddenly losing access to Basecamp  because of their firewall. On top of that, my customer doesn't have a way to externally share a  large file with me, so I found myself needing a SECURE method. Other programs like Liquid Files may have worked, but this keeps the files right where I need them most--OneDrive! My customer is delighted with this easy process and I'm delighted by the impeccable timing! ",False

"Amanda, I wanted to take a moment and thank you for keeping and eye out on the W2's until ADP could find someone to come get them. These W2's were not authorized by me to be filed, printed, or mailed. I had zero knowledge that they were released or delivered. When I read your email and saw the pictures you took, I went into panic mode. I was beside myself (truthfully I still am!) I called ADP immediately and as it turns out, it was an oversight on their part. In the 22 years I have been working with them, I have never seen this happen before, not ever.  In addition to the forms not formally being released by me, they also should never have been put into anyone else's hands, except my own.  That box contained all kinds of sensitive data, that if it got leaked would have lead to a bigger problem.  I cannot thank you enough for your initial reach out, asking the question, and your follow through of keeping them guarded until someone could get there.  I don't know what I would have done without you.  Thank you for your quick action and understanding about the severity of the situation.  Words cannot express my gratitude.",True

Jen, Chris, Kevin, and Jay – you were right there every step of the way on design iterations and animations.  Owen, you’ve been a master of the nuanced wordsmithing we’ve needed on this.  Matt, Biz, Geoff and Mark – you built, staged, tested, and launched all new site pages and elements in almost no time at all.  Your work set-up for a great launch – where we dragged in Anthony to build, test, and deploy our emails with about an hours time from asset to release.

Wipe down every counter space and desk. Make sure conference rooms were clean and equipped. Buy balloons and fresh flowers. You did it!! In 4 days you did it.

Any time that I let my guard down and commit something that has impact elsewhere, it always bounces back to me very promptly. It's also very reassuring how ""out there"" a lot of the issues may seem, with detailed replication steps that would be seemingly unlikely to occur in the wild.

"Kat, you're already hearing Mark, me, and the rest of the internal Organon team singing your praises in keeping the four separate workstreams on track, in your typical organized and efficient manner. As I told you last week, you won the record for the most emails sent last week that kept all Organon participants focused on agenda items and providing updates even while brains may have been fuzzy from their shutdown week. In this week in particular, I wanted to call out how you set your lasers in action to cut out any potential issues cropping up in the Conversations and Life Events workstreams.

The meeting had participants energized and remarking that they were counting on Workhuman to bring the same level of excitement throughout the launch process. On the Life Events front, we were facing some troubling privacy concerns and back and forth with changing players on the Organon side. You cut through the chatter and were able to guide the conversation and firmly push back against the privacy concerns listed, and I think we walked out of the meeting feeling good that a potential stumbling block has been removed and they would proceed with Life Events plans in a non-restrictive way. It was the perfect balance of firm and helpful in the conversation.

It was so refreshing to step outside of our day-to-day functions and immerse ourselves in what is happening in the advertising and overall digital marketing industry this year. Your discussion points and perspective were on point! How amazing is it that Instagram is now more than 50% of ""Meta"" revenue when we remember days of minimum $1M budgets to advertise there? What is the tipping point for brand safety and ad dollars on ""The Big Blue App""? How much will we be exposed and soon addicted to Viral Commerce? Is AVOD the future and SVOD stalling?

"Susana- well done managing through the changes needed to Elanco's program! What started as a request to make some program changes turned into quite the project....of many, many back and forths! A lot of curve balls were thrown your way,  but what was great to see was how you remained cool, calm  and collected to get across the finish line. You made it a priority to meet with the customer (regardless of what time it was locally), to walk them through what was configured, understand if that was the expected result, clarify what was the intended result and then communicate back to TS on what needed to happen. Even when the requested changes were not showing in Sandbox, you put aside the frustration and dealt with the problem head on. You always put the customer's needs first, even if it meant rolling up your sleeves up to figure out where the gaps were, and configuring the necessary changes yourself. Being able to be dynamic is a key skill set needed in this role, and you my friend demonstrated that quite well throughout this project! You should be very proud of yourself and what was accomplished to ensure this customer was set up for success! Thank you for your dedication and investment to ensuring the success of this project, and all of the other work you do across all of your customers!",False

"Where to start...the last few months have felt a bit like I decided to be a trapeze artist without any specific training - a change of role (defining a bit as we go), relying on my former training, skills, experiences and ideas and still trying to figure out where the 'equipment' and 'how to guides' are located - 'adjacent' to what I have done before but not quite.  The good news is that while I have been jumping into 'performances', I have had YOU to support and provide a safety net. Knowing you are a quick email, text, Slack or Teams message away, I know you have my back. You are consistent with our 1:1's, your follow up and guiding and directing while allowing me to be me...AND you go above and beyond - I asked you this week for some clarification and input for some meeting prep and not only did you answer but you took the time to pull together a skeleton set of slides. I was literally telling my husband last night how I was feeling a bit frustrated that I didn't know more than I do blah blah, and I woke up this morning to a recognition from you cheering on the work and results that I am feeling frustrated about. It is an example of you being you, the cheerleader, the coach, the exemplar...and supporting me while maintaining your own crazy schedule and list of to-do's. When I started on your team I was given the sage advice of ""you don't have to be Traci to be successful in this role"", and while I agree, it also gives me something to aspire to. Thank you!",False

With that said, here is what Marisa had to say about you: “I wanted to just send a quick note to let you know that Melissa was incredibly helpful last week. We noticed some major abuse through the alerts we get from the system and she was fantastic at quickly getting the teams to rescind what outstanding awards we could and then quickly worked to update our eligibility rules to pull out the employees that were noted for abuse while we research internally. Since I can’t give her a Bravo, I wanted to give you the positive feedback!”  Your quick turnaround and response helped ensure the impact of the abuse was minimal, which ensures we limit the exposure when these types of things happen. This is SO important, so thank you for taking a negative situation and turning it into a relationship win, by demonstrating the type of partnership we deliver even for those challenging times.

This was the first time we worked together and from call one, I know you were a ""gem"". You took ownership of the product configuration tasks, tested concepts, took calls on friday's late afternoon to valid the solution, willingly jumped on ad hoc calls with a sense of urgency, tapped into colleagues for quick responses on open questions and most importantly, brought your ""let's do this. can do. will do."" attitude to this project. This was a massive engagement with many elements from the Intro Panel configuration using a jpg to support and maintain a very polished message and photo, to adding the new #MomentsatEaton award reason to the first position on the award reason selection screen, to adding the new award reason hover over text, to the all employee 90,000+ appreciation day award from the the CHRO, Ernest Johnson and more!!!   Of course, it wasn't without changes to timelines. Eaton moved timelines on a few occasions and you adjusted all to accommodate. You truly are an amazing partner who's contributions to this project will forever be an incredible #Moment that matters to me for some many reasons. This campaign is not only tied to the CEOs, CHRO and Eaton's talent strategy but is allowing is to make progress on adding peer to peer awards with value after 8 years!!!

They can sometimes be a tough crowd and are set in their ways about the program but during the account review you could see the ah-ha moments when they realized they have some work to do to make it a better experience for their employees. Nice work setting the tone and showing them their strengths and opportunity areas. They were engaged with the presentation the whole time and asked questions that you were easily able to answer to navigate them in the right direction. Looking forward to working together to help right this ship! Congrats!,False
"Maya Angelou once said, ""This is a wonderful day. I have never seen this one before!”  This is a good reflection of the gratitude and the humbled amazement I have for our team.  I have worked with many analytics teams during my career - and this team is the most unique and special. I'm deeply grateful and humbled for what you all have created here at Workhuman!  You are truly an impressive group - a vibrant tapestry of humans.  Each of you has a different background, but are united in the belief that gratitude can have an impact on the lives of others and we can prove it!  I'm grateful for the variety of life experiences each of you brings to this team - certainly something that makes us stronger as a group.  I'm also grateful for the respect you show to one another - creating a strong sense of psychological safety and paving the way for deep connections as well as new innovations from our data. I'm also grateful for the deep expertise you bring to the team.  The training and experience each of you have is robust, impressive and varied.  This has resulted in one of the biggest differentiators for Workhuman in the marketplace, not to mention an impressive amount of heart-inspired brainpower unmatched by any other team in which I have worked.  So as this week of gratitude comes to a close, please take a moment to close your eyes, breathe deeply and reflect on your shared accomplishments, innovations and strong relationships.  I know I will!",False

"When we knew the DMS job wasn’t going to finish at a reasonable time last night, we discussed who in the team could verify the outcome in the early hours this morning, troubleshoot if required and re-start our own jobs after.

"Tricia you never cease to amaze me! I wanted to recognize you for an outstanding job this week into branching out into compliance management, audit management, security management. I realize that you hadn't had the opportunity to get your feet wet in these areas over the course of your career, but if I didnt tell me that, I would never had known it by the reflection in your work this week. First, you went head on with ADP to ensure we were complaint with their new labor laws regarding pay statement representation. Next I threw you a task to work with Robyn and ADP to find out all the details around implementing MFA and SSO to help keep us safe. Finally, you worked with our internal partners to ensure a one-time payment was cancelled in Workday so that a former employee wouldnt be paid for it. This was an awesome catch made by you alone and I am sure our external auditors will be impressed by it if this gets selected for review.  All these things (and so much more) are why you and your outstanding work ethic are of such value to me. Honestly, I dont know what I would do without you!

"If you google it, you can see definitions such as: The word humanity is from the Latin humanitas for ""human nature, kindness.” Humanity includes all the humans, but it can also refer to the kind feelings humans often have for each other. or it’s also a word for the qualities that make us human, such as the ability to love and have compassion, be creative, and not be a robot or alien.

In the busy periods of 2022 Q3 and Q4, you allowed the team to focus on improving messaging in exactly the way that you had strategically pointed us at. Ultimately, the Foundation team were only able to deploy our new Outbox solution to Production during that busy December period, because you had protected our team from all types of tempting disruptions over a significant number of months. If you had done any differently, and made multiple separate small asks/tweaks to us, or pulled us in different directions, we clearly wouldn't have succeeded - your support, alignment on the plan and focus on the core scope and priorities for messaging made that hard delivery possible - it's appreciated. (Yes, we are already glimpsing that we may need to achieve a similar alignment and determination in 2023's challenges and tight schedules - let's see how we go!)",False

"Leanne, congratulations on this feedback from Nuvance Health:  We wanted to share with you the initial response to our launch of BRAVO, Safety Stars on 1/19. Overall, the response has been overwhelming! As of 1/31/2023 we had 56 total recognitions with submissions from all 7 of our hospitals and our Medical Group. Users like the fact that all recognition is located in one platform and that it was so easy to use. The phone app was also a plus because many people do not have access to a computer.

"Kat and Mat, our recent onsite visit to Sanofi to connect with their North American team, conduct a UAT session, and guide them to some decisions made me think of this quote.

We went to Bridgewater to help Sanofi NA bury their old recognition program and Kat, you were our orator, commanding the room and skillfully navigating them through the test scripts and a multitude of other agenda topics such as post-launch support, admin reporting, additional programs and data privacy. Matt, you were that steady guiding force in the room, peppering in both jokes and clarifying remarks, jumping up to offer assistance, and covering a high-visibility Chanel call while onsite so Kat could focus on Sanofi. While it may not be Shakespeare, this quote is also attributed to Caesar: ""I came, I saw, I conquered"".

The successful delivery of the eCode fulfilment refactor was a critical initiative on the back-office roadmap as it guarantees a safety net for our Kafka migration, by delivering a more stable framework to support Q4 spikes in eCode orders. I'm always blown away by how the Cogs team continues deliver on key initiatives throughout the year while exemplifying all the qualities of a high-performing team - Teamwork, supporting each other, and taking ownership and accountability for our commitments.

"Congratulations to Dawn O’Brien and her team on this exceptional achievement.  The hard work, dedication, and perseverance during this lengthy sales cycle has paid off.  Dawn led the ongoing work and successfully won this significant customer.  Thank you to the entire team for all your valuable contributions throughout the past 18 months.  If there was a selling step along the way to “check off,” this deal included it.  Two Workhuman Live events, pushed start dates, an onsite presentation in the middle of a snowstorm, a 2 hour plant tour, numerous dinners, demonstrations, business case preparation, a prioritization committee, a very controlling IT Team, a highly risk averse organization and a final approval process that required sign off from the CEO (whose last name is Kohler), were just a sampling of the key events required for this deal.  This is a new program build for Kohler and will initially include 25,000 global employees.    Kohler Company was founded in 1873 and is an American manufacturing company based in Kohler, Wisconsin. Kohler is best known for its plumbing products, but the company also manufactures furniture, cabinetry, tile, engines, and generators.  Kohler also owns several world class resorts including hotels and spas at St. Andrews Scotland.",False

"Shane, I wanted to congratulate you on your recent achievements and thank you for the leadership and teamwork you've shown over the last few weeks. You brought together several people - members or not of your teams - to raise different points of view, strategies, opportunities and problems related to the nominations approval area. There were discussions at various company levels to arrive at different paths to be tested by the team. These investigations have been super important to define the way that not only your squads or the Recognition & Celebrations team should follow but the entire platform. You've also been exploring how to determine the structure and architecture of the elements in this space, how to componentise them and make them part of a larger vision connecting with our design system. It's gratifying to be able to discuss so many different paths forward with these elements there and in this area, but not only that, to discuss what this area can become and how it can play a much more significant role in the context of the recognition business. You've been doing a great job in that area, too, and by sharing your thinking with other designers, you're also helping them see different ways they can break down their problems and explore different solutions. Amidst all this, you've still found time to dedicate yourself to the designers on the team, supporting them by giving feedback on their designs and helping them with references, methods and much more. Your contribution to the team has been significant not only with what you’ve led in your teams but also in creating this safe and collaborative environment. Thank you for everything!",False

It’s easy to see why everyone loves working with you – you welcome in all perspectives, share your knowledge and expertise in a way that inspires others to do the same, tackle challenges with grace and determination, and stay calm under pressure.

You even answered some tricky questions masterfully. I know you found it challenging at times, but it didn't show at all! I think it was a very successful office hours and sparked some good conversations.  It shows how much you care about what you do, because you wanted to get it just right and answer all queries in the best way. I was very jealous of how diplomatically and eloquently you answered... you are gonna need to teach me your ways!! Once again, superb job on tackling this and all your hard work trying to get a component that works for all our design system users' needs. This component is in very safe hands and I can't wait to see how it goes in the next few weeks ����",False
"Amy, there almost aren't enough words to express my gratitude for how far our relationship has come. The psychological safety you have fostered, moments where you've pushed me to grow, and the support to do so that you've continued to give. I take something new from every conversation we have. I deeply appreciate how we have grown together and am so lucky to have found you as my leader after all of the change I have been through. As I wrote my first reflection, I reflected on the challenges and accomplishments I have experienced under your guidance. Giving me the opportunity to reflect and feel pride for so many reasons was a powerful exercise. Thank you for leading the way you do, albeit challenging at times, it's pushed me to truly look within and learn so much.",False

"To everyone in the Ecomm Platform Product-Development group – it’s early days in 2024 but I wanted to take this opportunity to recognise the huge contribution you have already made to Workhuman and our customers this year.  In January alone… you collectively built and released 37 individual Ecomm Platform Product enhancements!!!  That’s more than 1 a day!!  These included a whole host of improvements across Assortment & Pricing, Merchandising, Back Office Integrations, Client Support and Tech Modernization.  There are too many to name (again… 37 in total!). But some really exciting improvements from those 37 individual releases that spring to mind are:  1.	Preventing GRS Orders from being placed where the Catalog Costs differ significantly from the real-time GRS Costs. 2.	Improve GTIN Matching Confidence by comparing Supplier Brand with WH Brand before linking GTINs. 3.	By Pass the SKU Onboarding process for GRS where they are the only supplier in a particular country 4.	Deprecating the old Merchandise Fulfilment job. 5.	Migration of Client Fulfilled app to Dropship FF App 6.	Removing redundant Currency Service requests. 7.	Alerting for order messages which are “stuck”   Thank you all so much for the massive contribution you have made throughout the course of January. In all my time at Workhuman (nearly 12 years!) I honestly cannot remember so much great product enhancements being released by one product area in one month!!!  This just doesn't happen without incredible Innovation, Imagination and Determination!  Absolutely unbelievable!  Enjoy your award!  Frank",False
"Julian, you rockstar! You graced the Athens, Georgia marathon with your presence last Sunday and absolutely crushed it. I still can't believe you were secretly training for this for WEEKS while working full time AND finishing your PhD. You are a testament to hard work, dedication, and perseverance. I love how you incorporate wellness into everything you do, and you are such a great role model for prioritizing health and balance while still learning and reaching professional goals and milestones. The WHiQ team are so incredibly proud of you! And please expect a background of AI generated images like this one for your next marathon ;-)",False
"Well done Abel on the concept, the design, the tooling and the rollout of the gitlab reimagining of permissions and access. It's being a bug bear for many, for many years, on how to safely ""insource"" and give maximum access to developers while at the same time keeping everything safe and controlled. A difficult balance, well done for seeing it through to implementation and rollout.",False
"Just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude to each and every one of you for your outstanding efforts in keeping the fort safe and operations running smoothly during my recent annual leave.

From keeping an eye on the reports, avoiding and dealing with Escalations and keeping the SLA on a positive trend thought powering up results with out partners to minding the normal day to day tasks... t's a privilege to work alongside such a talented and dependable team.
